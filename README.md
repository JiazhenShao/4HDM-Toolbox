# 4-Higgs-Doublet-Model Tool Box

This repository provide codes for 4HDM study. Up to now, we updated code aiming at classification of cyclic symmetry of 4HDM. Just download the jupyter notebook file. Detailed explanations could be found in there. Naturally, you need environment to run the file. You can try Anaconda and other means. The code is a computer toolbox aiming at, but not limited to, 4HDM study as would be observed by you after downloading the file that this code can be easily generalized to the study of abelian symmetry of general NHDM. 

Later, we will update code for other abelian symmetry for 4HDM such as $\mathbb{Z}_2\times\mathbb{Z}_2$, $\mathbb{Z}_4\times\mathbb{Z}_2$ and $\mathbb{Z}_2\times\mathbb{Z}_2\times\mathbb{Z}_2$ if progresses are made.

**It is our pleasure if the code helped you during your research. Please add this website to the bibliography list of your paper if you are expecting publications.**
