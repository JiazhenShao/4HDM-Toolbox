# 4-Higgs-Doublet-Model Tool Box

This repository provide codes for 4HDM study. Up to now, we updated code aiming at classification of cyclic symmetry of 4HDM. Just download the jupyter notebook file. Detailed explanations could be found in there. Naturally, you need environment to run the file. You can try Anaconda and other means. The code is a computer toolbox aiming at, but not limited to, 4HDM study as would be observed by you after downloading the file that this code can be easily generalized to the study of abelian symmetry of general NHDM. 

Later, we will update code for other abelian symmetry for 4HDM such as $\mathbb{Z}_2\times\mathbb{Z}_2$, $\mathbb{Z}_4\times\mathbb{Z}_2$ and $\mathbb{Z}_2\times\mathbb{Z}_2\times\mathbb{Z}_2$ if progresses are made.

**It is our pleasure if the code helped you during your research. Please add this website to the bibliography list of your paper if you are expecting publications.**

------------

We uploaded the latest version of our toolbox which helps NHDM study. The latest code v2.0 includes:

* examples that studies all possible generators of the three remaining rephasing groups of 4HDM, such as $\mathbb{Z}_2\times\mathbb{Z}_2\times\mathbb{Z}_2$, other than simple cyclic groups;
* example functions that solves more complicated set of matrix equations in the $\mathbb{Z}_4\times\mathbb{Z}_4$ case, which can be generalized easily;
* code that obtains relations among coefficients given a $PSU(4)$ transformation in the $\mathbb{Z}_4\times\mathbb{Z}_4$ case;

With the new code v2.0, further development is still in need towards a full classification of 4HDM discrete symmetry. If the reader is interested, please contact the author via email, who welcomes discussions and potential colaboration!
